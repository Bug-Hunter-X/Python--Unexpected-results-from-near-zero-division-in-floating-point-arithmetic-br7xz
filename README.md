# Python: Near-Zero Division and Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python related to floating-point arithmetic.  Dividing by a number that is very close to zero, but not exactly zero, can lead to surprisingly large results, potentially causing numerical instability in calculations.

The `bug.py` file contains a function that illustrates this issue. The `bugSolution.py` offers a solution to handle such cases effectively.

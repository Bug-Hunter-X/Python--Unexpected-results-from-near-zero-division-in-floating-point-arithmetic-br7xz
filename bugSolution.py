def function_with_uncommon_error_solution(x, tolerance=1e-9):
    if abs(x) < tolerance:

    elif x > 0:
        return 1 / x
    else:
        return -1

# Example demonstrating improved handling:
result = function_with_uncommon_error_solution(1e-16)
print(result) # Output is now very large, but more manageable

# Example of how to deal with this type of errors in ML training:
# Instead of handling this by returning a max value, you could use alternative strategies:
# 1) Regularization to prevent overfitting
# 2) Clipping to restrict values within a given range
# 3) Using more stable numerical methods.
